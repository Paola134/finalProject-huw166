<p> hamsters are adorable. I pet them a lot and carry them. Pizza is my favorite food. I love mushrooms on my pizza. Mushrooms are healthy to eat. They taste better on spaghetti. I do not like fish. It's not part of my favorite food groups it make me sick.

<p>the worst thing that happened to me that is i get bullied everywhere. Even at school. Boys are bullies. I get humiliated all the time.That was moment I would forget forever.

 <p>I have friends that are loyal and generous. They give me nice gifts for my birthday and I give them nice gifts too. I have no friends that are boys I hate boys. 
 <p> fall is my favortie season.I love cuddling in blankets and cuddling my pet. I always believed in unicorns. Unicorns are beautiful and magical They always make me happy and protects me from danger. Not to mention they can fly also.

 <p> the golden corral is my favorite buffet. Plus, a warm experience. There is amazing food salad bar, plus a dessert bar with a chocolate fountain. It was wonderful. My friend and I had a great time. we had fun at six flags great escape even though Im scared of roller coasters.I went on some of the rides. Plus theres a water park there too. i enjoyed the ride where you slide down with a mat.

 <p> Art is my favorite subject. I enjoyed drawing, painting, sketching as a hobby. I took art classes before in laguadria I got A's. I never drew in shadows before but when I took beginning drawing I knew how. I need to a add a light on the object. Then, I sketch it and I drew its shadow.
